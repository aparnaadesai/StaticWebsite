					<p>
						Welcome to Odyssey!! This is an online website for travel enthusiasts providing interesting information about different cities from different countries. The information presented here is about the food, culture and facts related to the places. Unlike other travel websites which provide information about places to lure customers for buying holiday packages, Odyssey aims to offer information for the purpose of imparting knowledge to the user. The website creation was inspired from the National Geographic television series "Street Food Around the World".
					</p>
					<p>
						I am personally fond of getting knowledge about different cultures and countries. Odyssey picks up a few cities from various countries and explores about their food culture and provides interesting facts about the places. Another show to look out for if you are a travel enthusiast is "Lonely Planet", an older show but this was the one that increased my curiosity in gaining knowledge about the world. Knowing about different cultures gives you an advantage over others as you find easy to connect to new people. Therefore, Odyssey will not only increase your knowledge base, but also help you in making new social connections.

						Goals:
					<br/>
					1. Make the website an encyclopedia about different cities in the world!!
					<br/>
					2. Give interesting facts about different places.
					<br/>
					Currently the website is in the developing phase and therefore has limited content. Let us now start to explore!!
