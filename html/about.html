					<p>
						The website creation was a great learning experience. I realised that I should have made a single css instead of different css for different pages.
						I also understood the importance of including original content on the website. Apart from this, there is a long list of things I learnt while making this website.
						Although I had the knowledge about CSS and HTML while making the website I realised that there is always more to learn even if you are not a novice.
					</p>
					<p>
						The things that were new to me were including RSS feeds, social networking buttons, making story board and video, and adding animation to the images.The list is long 
						and above all I also learnt about the best practices while designing a website. Along with this due to the lectures on HCI I learnt about the design principles to be used while 
						designing websites.
					</p>
					<p>Things that I would have done differently: I would have created a single css for all the web pages. I would have made more efforts in collecting original content for the website.
						I would also include more HCI design principles in the website which would enhance the user experience.
